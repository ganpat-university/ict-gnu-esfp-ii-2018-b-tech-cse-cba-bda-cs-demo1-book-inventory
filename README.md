A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list
includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a
customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system
searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate
message is displayed.  otherwise the message “Sorry! These many books are
not in stock” is displayed. Design a system using a class called stock with suitable
member functions and constructors.
